# ðŸ§® Matrix Coding Problems

This repository contains a collection of matrix-based coding problems for practice and learning purposes. Each problem is implemented in Python and focuses on common operations and patterns in matrix manipulation.

## ðŸ”¢ List of Problems

1. **Print a Matrix Row-wise and Column-wise**
   - Traverse and print elements row-by-row and column-by-column.

2. **Calculate the Total Sum of Elements in a Matrix**
   - Sum up all the elements of the matrix.

3. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Values in Each Row of a Matrix**
   - For each row, identify the highest and lowest elements.

4. **Add and Subtract Two Matrices**
   - Perform element-wise addition and subtraction between two matrices.

5. **Calculate the Sum of Each Row and Each Column in a Matrix**
   - Compute and display the sum of individual rows and columns.

6. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Values in Each Column of a Matrix**
   - For each column, determine the highest and lowest values.

7. **Print the Upper Triangle and Lower Triangle of a Matrix**
   - Extract and display the upper and lower triangular parts of a square matrix.

8. **Print the Left and Right Diagonals of a Matrix**
   - Display the elements along the main and anti-diagonal of a square matrix.

9. **Find the Inverse of a Matrix**
   - Use appropriate mathematical methods or libraries (like NumPy) to find the inverse.

10. **Print the Boundary Elements of a Matrix**
    - Print the elements on the boundary (edges) of the matrix.

11. **Sort the Matrix Row-wise and Column-wise**
    - Sort each row and each column of the matrix independently.

12. **Print the Matrix in a Zig-Zag Pattern**
    - Traverse the matrix in a zig-zag or snake-like pattern.

13. **Check if a Matrix is Symmetric**
    - Determine if the matrix is symmetric (equal to its transpose).

14. **Check if a Matrix is an Identity Matrix**
    - Check whether the matrix is an identity matrix (diagonal = 1, others = 0).

15. **Check if a Matrix is Sparse**
    - Identify if the matrix contains mostly zero elements.
