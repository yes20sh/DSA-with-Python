## 📋 List of Questions and Descriptions

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
**Task**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers.

### 2. Sum of Digits
**Task**: Calculate the sum of all digits in a given number.  
📌 Example: `1234 → 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`

### 3. Reverse a Number
**Task**: Reverse the digits of a given number.  
📌 Example: `1234 → 4321`

### 4. Palindrome Check
**Task**: Check if a number is a palindrome (same when reversed).  
📌 Example: `121 → Palindrome`, `123 → Not Palindrome`

### 5. Armstrong Number
**Task**: Check if a number is an Armstrong number.  
📌 Example: `153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153`

### 6. Count Occurrences of Digit '1'
**Task**: Count total times digit '1' appears in all numbers from 1 to `n`.

### 7. Fibonacci Series
**Task**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit.  
📌 Example: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`

### 8. Factorial of a Number
**Task**: Calculate the factorial of a given number.  
📌 Example: `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

### 9. Co-Prime Check
**Task**: Check if two numbers are co-prime (GCD is 1).

### 10. Find All Divisors
**Task**: List all positive integers that divide the given number.

### 11. Divisibility Rules (1–20)
**Task**: Implement rules to check if a number is divisible by each number from 1 to 20.

### 12. Trailing Zeroes in Factorial
**Task**: Count the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (factorial of n).

### 13. LCM and GCD
**Task**: Compute both the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

### 14. Prime Number Check (No Sieve)
**Task**: Check if a number is prime **without** using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

### 15. Modulo Operation
**Task**: Perform and explain the modulo operation between two numbers.  
📌 Example: `10 % 3 = 1`
