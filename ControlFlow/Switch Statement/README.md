# Switch Statement Programs

This repository contains four Python programs demonstrating the use of the `switch` statement logic (using dictionary-based approach since Python lacks a built-in switch statement). Each program solves a specific problem using `match-case`.

## Programs Included

### 1. Weekday Name Finder
**Description**: This program takes a week number (1-7) as input and returns the corresponding weekday name. 
- **Assumption**: 1 is Monday, and 7 is Sunday.


### 2. Maximum Between Two Numbers
**Description**: This program takes two numbers as input and determines the maximum between them using `match-case`.


### 3. Even or Odd Checker
**Description**: This program takes an integer as input and checks whether it is even or odd using `match-case`.


### 4. Vowel Word Finder
**Description**: This program takes a vowel as input and returns a word starting with that vowel. 
- **Assumption**: Inputs are in lowercase (`a, e, i, o, u`).



## Requirements
- Python 3.x
