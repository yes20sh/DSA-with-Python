# Tricky Triangle Number Patterns

## Overview
This project generates various **tricky triangle number patterns** based on specific rules. These patterns are useful for learning number sequences, logic building, and pattern printing techniques in programming.

## Patterns
Below are the four tricky triangle number patterns generated:

### Pattern 1
```
    1
    10
    101
