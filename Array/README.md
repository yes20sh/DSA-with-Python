# Array Basics

This repository contains fundamental array operations implemented in Python. These operations include traversing, modifying, and analyzing arrays with various techniques.

---

### 1. Print each element and its index
Iterate through the array and print each element along with its index.

### 2. Print elements in reverse order
Print the elements of the array starting from the last to the first.

### 3. Print alternate elements
Print every alternate element of the array.

### 4. Create a duplicate of an array
Create a new array that contains the same elements as the original array.

### 5. Delete an element at a given position
Remove an element at the Xth index and shift the remaining elements to the left.

### 6. Create arrays for odd and even elements
Create two new arrays, one containing only odd numbers and the other containing only even numbers.

### 7. Calculate sum and product
Compute the sum and product of all elements in the array.

### 8. Count occurrences of a target number
Count how many times a given number appears in the array.

### 9. Check if an array is sorted
Check if an array is sorted in ascending, descending order, or not sorted at all.

### 10. Count seen and duplicate elements
Count the number of unique elements and duplicates in an array of numbers ranging from 1 to 100.

### 11. Check if two elements sum to a target
Find if there exist two numbers in the array whose sum equals a given target value.

### 12. Check if three elements sum to a target
Find if there exist three numbers in the array whose sum equals a given target value.

### 13. Find the maximum element
Find the maximum value present in the array.

### 14. Find the minimum element
Find the minimum value present in the array.

### 15. Find the 2nd maximum element
Find the second largest number in the array. If it doesn’t exist, return -1.

### 16. Find the 2nd minimum element
Find the second smallest number in the array. If it doesn’t exist, return -1.

### 17. Insert an element at a given position
Insert a new element at a given position and shift the rest of the elements to the right.
